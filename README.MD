**Caveat**: In Elgato Control Center, above S/N is represented as 749968294597


I haven't had a chance to dig into the firmware yet, but I'm trying to figure out how they change the actual serial number, to the one shown in Control Center. (It might be a very simple thing, I just haven't started looking at it yet.)

This repo will be updated as I study and get more into the firmware.
